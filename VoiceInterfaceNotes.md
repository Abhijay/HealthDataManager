# 1. The Big Questions
* What is the landscape of open source voice engines/agents?
* Who are the big players in the field?
  * Google, Siri, Amazon (not even Siri at this point)
* What are the variables between their products (shown in a table matrix)?
* Do audio demo in presentation with an example app.
* We want to construct an “optimized voice encounter”
* Our goal is to prototype voice encounters and optimize for sound and then build it into an app to collect health data. 

# 2. Industry and Problems
Most widely used voice assistants (as of May 2017):
* Apple Siri - 34%
* Google Assistant - 19%
* Amazon Alexa - 6%
* Microsoft Cortana - 4%
Stats on Alexa and Google:

Open source voice assistants:

Mycroft 
* Incredibly small user base (15 people on Github)
* Problem: since voice assistants function based of ML and AI algorithms, it is important to have a large dataset for good functionality
* Less data = less capabilities
* Python 

“It’s always been sort of appalling to me that you now have a supercomputer in your pocket, yet you have to learn how to use it. It seems actually like a failure on the part of out industry that software is hard to use.” - Alan Packer, head of language technology at Facebook
* It is difficult to design an intuitive voice interface
* Ie: Amazon Echo come with an example phrase list to help users use the device
* It is difficult to know the full limitations/capabilities of the device

Voice has been under scrutiny for security and how tech giants utilize your data. Thus,
Voice and health must put a lot of focus onto privacy.
Voice should focus more on doing and showing than saying 
“Ok, now showing patient data…”
Alexa and Google must be in a constant listening state to hear for their keyword
Audio is then transcribed for company data and used for advertising etc.
Keyword must be said for each statement by the user, this can become annoying over time

# 3. Development references 
* Possible development tools:
* Amazon Alexa SDK
* Google Assistant SDK 
* Mycroft

# 4. A lot of web resources
What kind of interface are people mostly using:

* Voice good for clinical trials and surveys
* Voice provides comfort to patients
